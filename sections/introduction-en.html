<span class="markdown">The Footology Ontology was developed in response to the growing need for a standarized representaion of the Football (Soccer) Domain data from various data sources and platforms. Currently, most of the Artificial Intelligence Applications are mainly based on sub-symbolic approaches, utilizing machine learning, deep learning and data-driven techniques. Although these methods have shown incredible results, however, there is still an unexplored field in the symbolic AI, which includes ontologies and knowledge graphs. With introduction of symbolic AI, new paths emerge, like the ability to represent (football) knowledge, relationships, and concepts in a structured and semantically meaningful way. Ontologies can help with integrating and representation of complex relationships within football data, which provides good support in advanced analytics and much more. The goal of Footology is develop a standardized representaion and exchange of Football data to ensure compatibility among systems, databases, applications, etc.
